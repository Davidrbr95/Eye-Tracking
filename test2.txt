- 3 areas of our vision\
    - Foveal area\
        - Area that we are focused on\
        - Very small (1-2 degrees)\
    - Para-Foveal area\
        - Area between the Foveal and Peripheral areas\
    - Peripheral area\
        - The blurry areas of our visual field\
        - Image produced is blurry and less colorful\
        - Can really only see movement\
- Eye Movements\
    - Place information that interests us on the fovea\
        - Fixations\
            - The pause of the eye movement on a specific area of the visual field\
        - Saccades\
            - The rapid movements between fixations\
    - Keep image stationary on the retina in spite of movements of the object or one\'92s head: called smooth pursuit\
    - Prevent stationary objects from fading perceptually\
- We only focus on a fraction of the information we could potentially process\
    - This process is called attention\
- Overt vs Covert attention\
    - Overt: our gaze follows our attention shift\
    - Covert: moving our mind\'92 attention to peripheral areas without eye movement\
- We need time to perceive something \
    - Length of time depends on variety of factors\
- Eye Movements are typically analyzed in terms of fixations and saccades\

\
- Goes through a bunch of predictions concerning eye movements and looks at evidence to see if the predictions are confirmed, rejected, or not confirmed.\
\
- Eye movements in decision making are partially driven by task demands, i.e. by describing the attention and decision processes as segregated process streams sees the former being dependent on the latter\
- Eye movements in decision making are partially driven by stimulus properties that bias information uptake in favor of visually salient stimuli\
- Eye movements do not have a causal effect on preference formation; however through properties inherent to the visual system, such as stimulus-drive attention, eye movements do lead to down-stream effects on decision making\
- Decision makers optimize eye movements to reduce the demand on working memory and, in some cases, to reduce the number of fixations and length of saccades needed to complete the decision task. \
- The drivers of eye movements in decision making change dynamically within tasks, such as in attention phases, and across time, such as through learning effects.}
